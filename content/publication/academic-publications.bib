	abstract = {We aim to develop a hybrid model for earlier and more accurate predictions for the number of infected cases in pandemics by (1) using patients’ claims data from different counties and states that capture local disease status and medical resource utilization; (2) utilizing demographic similarity and geographical proximity between locations; and (3) integrating pandemic transmission dynamics into a deep learning model.We proposed a spatio-temporal attention network (STAN) for pandemic prediction. It uses a graph attention network to capture spatio-temporal trends of disease dynamics and to predict the number of cases for a fixed number of days into the future. We also designed a dynamics-based loss term for enhancing long-term predictions. STAN was tested using both real-world patient claims data and COVID-19 statistics over time across US counties.STAN outperforms traditional epidemiological models such as susceptible-infectious-recovered (SIR), susceptible-exposed-infectious-recovered (SEIR), and deep learning models on both long-term and short-term predictions, achieving up to 87\% reduction in mean squared error compared to the best baseline prediction model.By combining information from real-world claims data and disease case counts data, STAN can better predict disease status and medical resource utilization.},

	abstract = {The attention mechanism has demonstrated superior performance for inference over nodes in graph neural networks (GNNs), however, they result in a high computational burden during both training and inference. We propose FastGAT, a method to make attention based GNNs lightweight by using spectral sparsification to generate an optimal pruning of the input graph. This results in a per-epoch time that is almost linear in the number of graph nodes as opposed to quadratic. We theoretically prove that spectral sparsification preserves the features computed by the GAT model, thereby justifying our algorithm. We experimentally evaluate FastGAT on several large real world graph datasets for node classification tasks under both inductive and transductive settings. FastGAT can dramatically reduce (up to {\textbackslash}textbf\{10x\}) the computational time and memory requirements, allowing the usage of attention based GNNs on large graphs.},

This guarantee holds uniformly for all incoherent matrices of rank r. In our method, we propose to use a novel matrix norm called the mixed-norm along with the maximum l2 norm of the columns to design a novel convex relaxation for low-rank recovery that is tailored to our observation model. We also show that our proposed mixed-norm, the standard nuclear norm, and the max-norm are particular instances of convex regularization of low-rankness via tensor norms. Finally, we provide a scalable ADMM algorithm for the mixed-norm based method and demonstrate its empirical performance via large-scale simulations.},

	abstract = {The ongoing pandemic has highlighted the importance of reliable and efficient clinical trials in healthcare. Trial sites, where the trials are conducted, are chosen mainly based on feasibility in terms of medical expertise and access to a large group of patients. More recently, the issue of diversity and inclusion in clinical trials is gaining importance. Different patient groups may experience the effects of a medical drug/ treatment differently and hence need to be included in the clinical trials. These groups could be based on ethnicity, co-morbidities, age, or economic factors. Thus, designing a method for trial site selection that accounts for both feasibility and diversity is a crucial and urgent goal. In this paper, we formulate this problem as a ranking problem with fairness constraints. Using principles of fairness in machine learning, we learn a model that maps a clinical trial description to a ranked list of potential trial sites. Unlike existing fairness frameworks, the group membership of each trial site is non-binary: each trial site may have access to patients from multiple groups. We propose fairness criteria based on demographic parity to address such a multi-group membership scenario. We test our method on 480 real-world clinical trials and show that our model results in a list of potential trial sites that provides access to a diverse set of patients while also ensuing a high number of enrolled patients.},

We assume that the medium is homogeneous and, hence,  wave propagation is fully coherent. This work is an extension of our previous paper [A. Novikov,  M. Moscoso, and G. Papanicolaou, SIAM J. Imaging Sci., 8 (2015), pp. 1547--1573], where we showed that using linear combinations of intensity-only measurements, obtained from \$N{\textasciicircum}2\$ illuminations, imaging of localized scatterers can be carried out  efficiently using imaging methods based on the singular value decomposition of the time-reversal matrix. Here we show that the same strategy can be accomplished with only \$3N-2\$ illuminations, therefore enormously reducing the data acquisition process. Furthermore, we show that in the paraxial regime one can form the images by using six illuminations only.  In particular, this  paraxial  regime includes Fresnel and Fraunhofer diffraction.  The key point of this work is that if one controls the illuminations, imaging with intensity only can be easily reduced to an  imaging with phases and, therefore, one can apply standard imaging techniques. Detailed numerical simulations illustrate the performance of the proposed imaging strategy with and without data noise.},

	abstract = {Tensor completion aims at imputing missing entries from a partially observed tensor. Existing tensor completion methods often assume either multi-linear or nonlinear relationships between latent components. However, real-world tensors have much more complex patterns where both multi-linear and nonlinear relationships may coexist. In such cases, the existing methods are insufficient to describe the data structure. This paper proposes a Joint mUlti-linear and nonLinear IdentificAtion (JULIA) framework for large-scale tensor completion. JULIA unifies the multi-linear and nonlinear tensor completion models with several advantages over the existing methods: 1) Flexible model selection, i.e., it fits a tensor by assigning its values as a combination of multi-linear and nonlinear components; 2) Compatible with existing nonlinear tensor completion methods; 3) Efficient training based on a well-designed alternating optimization approach. Experiments on six real large-scale tensors demonstrate that JULIA outperforms many existing tensor completion algorithms. Furthermore, JULIA can improve the performance of a class of nonlinear tensor completion methods. The results show that in some large-scale tensor completion scenarios, baseline methods with JULIA are able to obtain up to 55\% lower root mean-squared-error and save 67\% computational complexity.},

	abstract = {In many practical applications including remote sensing, multi-task learning, and multi-spectrum imaging, data are described as a set of matrices sharing a common column space. We consider the joint estimation of such matrices from their noisy linear measurements. We study a convex estimator regularized by a pair of matrix norms. The measurement model corresponds to block-wise sensing and the reconstruction is possible only when the total energy is well distributed over blocks. The first norm, which is the maximum-block-Frobenius norm, favors such a solution. This condition is analogous to the notion of low-spikiness in matrix completion or column-wise sensing. The second norm, which is a tensor norm on a pair of suitable Banach spaces, induces low-rankness in the solution together with the first norm. We demonstrate that the joint estimation provides a significant gain over the individual recovery of each matrix when the number of matrices sharing a column space and the ambient dimension of the shared column space are large relative to the number of columns in each matrix. The convex estimator is cast as a semidefinite program and an efficient ADMM algorithm is derived. The empirical behavior of the convex estimator is illustrated using Monte Carlo simulations and recovery performance is compared to existing methods in the literature.},

In the case of narrowband sources this can be reduced to the problem of spectral line estimation, where our goal is simply to estimate the active frequencies from a weighted mixture of pure sinusoids. There exists a plethora of modern and classical methods that effectively solve this problem. However, for a wide variety of applications the underlying sources are not narrowband and can have an appreciable amount of bandwidth. In this work, we extend classical greedy algorithms for sparse recovery (e.g., orthogonal matching pursuit) to localize broadband sources. We leverage models for samples of broadband signals based on a union of Slepian subspaces, which are more aptly suited for dealing with spectral leakage and dynamic range disparities. We show that by using these models, our adapted algorithms can successfully localize broadband sources under a variety of adverse operating scenarios. Furthermore, we show that our algorithms outperform complementary methods that use more standard Fourier models. We also show that we can perform estimation from compressed measurements with little loss in fidelity as long as the number of measurements are on the order of the signal's implicit degrees of freedom. We conclude with an in-depth application of these ideas to the problem of localization in multi-sensor arrays.},
